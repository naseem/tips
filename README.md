# TipCalculator

This is a Tip Calculator application for iOS submitted as the [pre-assignment](https://gist.github.com/timothy1ee/7747214) requirement for CodePath.

Time spent: 4 hours

Completed:

* [X] Required: User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] Required: Settings page to change the default tip percentage. (I did this a little differently: the tip percentage you select is always remembered across app restarts. The settings allows you to choose the percentages that are displayed)
* [] Optional: UI animations
* [X] Optional: Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [] Optional: Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Optional: Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing. (Only do this if the bill amount is not cached)
